    "Profiling is the process of understanding the current state of the data. At the beginning of this process, we need to find out information, including:\n",
    "1. What is the definition of this data?\n",
    "2. What is the definition of each column?\n",
    "3. What should be the column data type?\n",
    "4. What are the allowed values for each column?\n",

    "Checking the correctness at the cell level, including:\n",
    "- correct data type, e.g., age is int, not str\n",
    "- allowed values, e.g., age > 0\n",
    "- correct structure, e.g., date formatted YYYY-MM-DD\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Set-based profiling\n",

    "Structuring is the process of changing the structure of data, including:\n",
    "- sorting rows and columns\n",
    "- splitting fields, e.g., `created_at:2020-12-31 -> (create_year:2020, create_month:12, create_date:31)`\n",

    "##### Enrichment\n",
    "Enrichment is the process of enriching a dataset, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enrichment can be achieved by joining with other datasets, e.g., `Transactions JOIN Customers ON customer_id` to obtain demographic information from transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enrichment can also be derived from value derivation, providing additional information through calculations such as:\n",
    "- calculating the remaining warranty period from `purchase_date` and `guarantee_duration`\n",
    "- predicting sentiment from `comments` in the `ProductReview` dataset\n",
    "- finding location from `address` using the Google Maps API on `Outlets` data"
